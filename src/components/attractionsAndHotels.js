Its construction was started by the Teutonic Knights in 1218, and after their expulsion, it was completed by the Cistercians. A bell tower was erected above the square in 1461. The church building itself was never fortified but was protected by a 14-meter-high surrounding wall, strengthened with five defense towers, a zwinger, and a moat. A valuable feature preserved to this day is the living quarters and storage rooms spread over 4 floors on the inner side of the wall, with a walkway behind.The main attraction inside the church is the triptych altar, with the crucifixion scene on the central panel. In 1999, the church was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.",

If you love them, you can adopt one from a distance by donating money monthly for food and treatment. The place is special, and you can see rescued and cared for animals in their natural environment. The Zărnești City Hall has provided the association with 69 hectares of forest to complete its project. The story began with the bear Maya, who was kept in a metal cage for six years in Brașov, as an attraction for a local pub's customers. The World Society for the Protection of Animals complained at the time about the cruelty with which the bear was treated, and Cristina Lapis, the founder of the project, who took care of abandoned dogs, decided to take care of bears as well. The bear sanctuary in Zărnești can be visited all year round from Tuesday to Sunday. Children under five cannot visit the bears for safety reasons. The ticket prices vary depending on the day you decide to visit and the age of the visitor.",
